# Title: to find

## Abstract

HIV-1 remains a major global health challenge, and developing effective inhibitors for this virus is a critical yet complex goal for both industry and academia. Our objective is to identify families of ligands with shared properties that inhibit HIV-1, facilitating the design of novel, targeted inhibitors. To achieve this, we plan to cluster these ligands based on their structural characteristics. Additionally, to efficiently evaluate the binding affinities of potential new ligands, we aim to use machine learning to predict their binding affinity to HIV-1. This in silico approach offers a faster and more cost-effective alternative to traditional experimental testing, accelerating the development of promising candidates.

## Research questions

- What are the most studied targets in academy and in industry ?
- Can we find families of ligand that inhibits HIV1 and what are their properties ?
- Can we predict the affinity of new ligands ?
